The Entertainment Recommendation System is a web-based application focused on delivering personalized movie discovery and engagement. It offers a full suite of features to enhance the user's experience, starting with account creation and secure login/logout functionality, alongside session management to maintain user identity across the platform. Users can view and update their profiles, manage genre preferences, change their passwords, or deactivate/delete their accounts when needed.

A core feature is the watchlist system, allowing users to save, manage, and categorize movies as watched or unwatched in a clean, responsive layout. The system also integrates dynamic movie charts, displaying top trending films weekly or monthly using real-time data from the TMDB API. Users can explore movies by viewing details such as title, release year, ratings, and overview, and visualize popular genres through interactive charts.

Additionally, the platform supports a user-driven ratings and reviews system, where users can submit star ratings and written feedback, and also view contributions from others along with posting dates, average ratings, and total review counts. The advanced search functionality includes real-time search suggestions, recent search history, trending keywords, filter and sort options by genre, release date, rating, and moreâ€”plus voice search capabilities using the Web Speech API.

This system is built to create an immersive and intelligent movie browsing experience tailored to individual tastes and behaviors.
